            I enjoy problem solving, whether I’m finding ways to make processes more efficient, turning around an at-risk project, or working with developers to design a system.  I’m a consensus builder and a bridge builder, with the ability to maintain a neutral perspective.

            Some people describe me as a Swiss Army Knife -- with experience in Scrum Master, Business Analyst, Project Management, and leadership roles, I can fit in anywhere and can help teams get their work done... and have fun doing it!
